# Bayesian Covariate-Assisted Interaction Analysis for Multivariate Count Data in Microbiome Study
SP-BGFM (Sparse Bayesian Group Factor Model for Feature Interactions in Multiple Count Tables Data) is a Bayesian semi-parametric model for multiple domains of next-generation sequencing microbiome abundance data. It models cross-domain interaction between microbial features directly using observed count tables, and provides a flexible DP mixture structure for interpretation.
